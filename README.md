# Loan Default Prediction with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Model

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning model using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict loan default based on historical loan data. The model utilizes various financial features, including credit score, income, and loan amount, to make accurate predictions.

## Project Structure
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter Notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model development.
- **`data/`**: Dataset used for training and testing the model.
- **`src/`**: Python scripts or modules for reusable code.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Dependencies required to run the project.
